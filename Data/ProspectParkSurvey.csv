Also I noticed too many people still working out on apparatus the workout area around Reeve/Vanderbilt Places and Prospect Park SW with nobody visibly wiping down things, and one family's children were still playing at Vanderbilt Playground despite it and the gate being closed."

I go to the park to run almost every day and have noticed the best time to practice social distancing is early in the morning. After 5 pm it is almost impossible to keep enough distance from other people

I really hope the park remains available for use throughout this time, as it is a great resource for exercise and mental health."
